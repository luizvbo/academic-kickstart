I am a Data Scientist working for ING Wholesale Bank Advanced Analytics (WBAA) in Amsterdam.

I have been working with Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Evolutionary Computation in Academia and Industry for the past 10 years with publications in the main Evolutionary Computation conferences (GECCO, CEC, PPSN, EvoStar).
