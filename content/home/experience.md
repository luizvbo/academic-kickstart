  I was involved in the process of building predictive models for investment risk in startups. The process involves:
  - Retrieving data from different sources, including scrapping data from the web (using selenium with Beautiful Soup).
  - Analysing the data, using Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib.
  - Building Machine Learning models using Random Forest and SVM to fit our prediction problems.
  - Feature selection/engineering.

  I was working on two different projects with the LaIC (Computational Intelligence Laboratory) research group:

  1. Reducing the exponential size of solutions generated by the Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) framework. The main objective is to reduce the solutions in order to improve their interpretability and reduce memory and computational cost.

  2. Analysing datasets used as benchmark for Genetic Programming (GP)-based methods under a Data Science perspective: We intend to gather datasets employed by the main publications in GP field in the last five years and analyse the viability of using GP to induce regression models.

  I worked on the development of autonomous tugs, capable of towing the aircraft in the airport ground, from the runway to the gates—during arrivals—and vice versa—during departures.

  Activities performed:
  1. Surveyed current advances in autonomous vehicles and worked on optimization of ground routes in airports;

  2. Worked in coordination with United Technologies;

  3. Worked with Python (build a parser for XML airport maps) and Java/CPLEX (route optimization).
