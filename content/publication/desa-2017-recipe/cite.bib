 abstract = {Automatic Machine Learning is a growing area of machine learning that has a similar objective to the area of hyper-heuristics: to automatically recommend optimized pipelines, algorithms or appropriate parameters to specific tasks without much dependency on user knowledge. The background knowledge required to solve the task at hand is actually embedded into a search mechanism that builds personalized solutions to the task. Following this idea, this paper proposes RECIPE (REsilient ClassifIcation Pipeline Evolution), a framework based on grammar-based genetic programming that builds customized classification pipelines. The framework is flexible enough to receive different grammars and can be easily extended to other machine learning tasks. RECIPE overcomes the drawbacks of previous evolutionary-based frameworks, such as generating invalid individuals, and organizes a high number of possible suitable data pre-processing and classification methods into a grammar. Results of f-measure obtained by RECIPE are compared to those two state-of-the-art methods, and shown to be as good as or better than those previously reported in the literature. RECIPE represents a first step towards a complete framework for dealing with different machine learning tasks with the minimum required human intervention.},
