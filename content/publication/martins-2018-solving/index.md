abstract: Advances in Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) have shown that
  this variant of Genetic Programming (GP) reaches better results than its predecessor
  for supervised machine learning problems, particularly in the task of symbolic regression.
  However, by construction, the geometric semantic crossover operator generates individuals
  that grow exponentially with the number of generations, resulting in solutions with
  limited use. This paper presents a new method for individual simplification named
  GSGP with Reduced trees (GSGP-Red). GSGP-Red works by expanding the functions generated
  by the geometric semantic operators. The resulting expanded function is guaranteed
  to be a linear combination that, in a second step, has its repeated structures and
  respective coefficients aggregated. Experiments in 12 real-world datasets show that
  it is not only possible to create smaller and completely equivalent individuals
  in competitive computational time, but also to reduce the number of nodes composing
  them by 58 orders of magnitude, on average.
