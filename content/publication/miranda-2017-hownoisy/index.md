abstract: Noise is a consequence of acquiring and pre-processing data from the environment,
  and shows fluctuations from different sources---e.g., from sensors, signal processing
  technology or even human error. As a machine learning technique, Genetic Programming
  (GP) is not immune to this problem, which the field has frequently addressed. Recently,
  Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP), a semantic-aware branch of GP, has
  shown robustness and high generalization capability. Researchers believe these characteristics
  may be associated with a lower sensibility to noisy data. However, there is no systematic
  study on this matter. This paper performs a deep analysis of the GSGP performance
  over the presence of noise. Using 15 synthetic datasets where noise can be controlled,
  we added different ratios of noise to the data and compared the results obtained
  with those of a canonical GP. The results show that, as we increase the percentage
  of noisy instances, the generalization performance degradation is more pronounced
  in GSGP than GP. However, in general, GSGP is more robust to noise than GP in the
  presence of up to 10% of noise, and presents no statistical difference for values
  higher than that in the test bed.
