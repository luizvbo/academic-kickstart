abstract: Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) is a method that exploits
  the geometric properties describing the spatial relationship between possible solutions
  to a problem in an n-dimensional semantic space. In symbolic regression problems,
  n is equal to the number of training instances. Although very effective, the GSGP
  semantic space can become excessively big in most real applications, where the value
  of n is high, having a negative impact on the effectiveness of the GSGP search process.
  This paper tackles this problem by reducing the dimensionality of GSGP semantic
  space in symbolic regression problems using instance selection methods. Our approach
  relies on weighting functions-to estimate the relative importance of each instance
  based on its position with respect to its nearest neighbours-and on dimensionality
  reduction techniques-to improve the notion of closeness between instances, generating
  datasets with simplified input spaces. Experiments were performed on a set of 15
  datasets and our experimental analysis shows that using instance selection by instance
  weighting and dimensionality reduction does improve the effectiveness of the search
  with almost no impact on root mean square error results.
