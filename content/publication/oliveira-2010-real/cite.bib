 abstract = {This work presents a classification technique based on artificial immune system (AIS). The method consists of a modification of the real-valued negative selection (RNS) algorithm for pattern recognition. Our approach considers a modification in two of the algorithm parameters: the detector radius and the number of detectors for each class. We present an illustrative example. Preliminary results obtained shows that our approach is promising. Our implementation is developed in Java using the Weka environment.},
