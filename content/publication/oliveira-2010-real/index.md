abstract: 'This work presents a classification technique based on artificial immune
  system (AIS). The method consists of a modification of the real-valued negative
  selection (RNS) algorithm for pattern recognition. Our approach considers a modification
  in two of the algorithm parameters: the detector radius and the number of detectors
  for each class. We present an illustrative example. Preliminary results obtained
  shows that our approach is promising. Our implementation is developed in Java using
  the Weka environment.'
