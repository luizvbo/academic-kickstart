abstract: This work presents a technique based on artificial immune system (AIS) for
  MR brain image classification. The method is an approach based on real-valued negative
  selection (RNS) algorithm and the use of a genetic algorithm to find a good combination
  of the input parameters in the classifier. The tests were carried out on synthetic
  MR brain images containing multiple sclerosis lesions. Preliminary results obtained
  shows that our approach is promising. Our implementation is developed in Java using
  the Weka environment.
