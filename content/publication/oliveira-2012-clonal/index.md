abstract: This study proposes a new algorithm for supervised learning, based on the
  clonal selection principle exhibited in natural and artificial immune systems. The
  method, called Clonal Selection Classifier with Data Reduction (CSCDR), utilizes
  a fitness function based on the number of correct and incorrect pattern classifications
  made by each antibody. The algorithm tries to maximize this value through clonal
  selection processes such as mutation, affinity maturation and selection of the best
  individuals, transforming the training phase in an optimization problem. This leads
  to antibodies with more representativeness and thus decreases the amount of prototypes
  generated at the end of the algorithm. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
  of the UCI machine learning repository demonstrated the effectiveness of the CSCDR
  algorithm as a classification technique, combined with a considerable data reduction
  when compared to the results obtained by the well known Artificial Immune Recognition
  System (AIRS) and the original Clonal Selection Classifier Algorithm (CSCA).
