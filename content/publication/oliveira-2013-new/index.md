abstract: This work borrows the traditional Pittsburgh-style representation from Genetic-Based
  Machine Learning and evaluates its performance in artificial immune systems (AIS)
  for classification. Our main goal is to select as few instances as possible to represent
  the data from the training set without losing accuracy. The new representation is
  tested in a modified version of a clonal selection algorithm, where the antibodies
  represent lists of prototypes instead of a single one. The generated method, named
  Clonal Selection Prototypes Generator, was tested in 10 UCI datasets and compared
  to other seven methods that execute the same task. Results showed that the proposed
  method is very good at considering a trade-off between the number of prototypes
  generated and the accuracy of the system.
