abstract: Recent advances in geometric semantic genetic programming (GSGP) have shown
  that the results obtained by these methods can outperform those obtained by classical
  genetic programming algorithms, in particular in the context of symbolic regression.
  However, there are still many open issues on how to improve their search mechanism.
  One of these issues is how to get around the fact that the GSGP crossover operator
  cannot generate solutions that are placed outside the convex hull formed by the
  individuals of the current population. Although the mutation operator alleviates
  this problem, we cannot guarantee it will find promising regions of the search space
  within feasible computational time. In this direction, this paper proposes a new
  geometric dispersion operator that uses multiplicative factors to move individuals
  to less dense areas of the search space around the target solution before applying
  semantic genetic operators. Experiments in sixteen datasets show that the results
  obtained by the proposed operator are statistically significantly better than those
  produced by GSGP and that the operator does indeed spread the solutions around the
  target solution.
