abstract: 'Genetic programming approaches are moving from analysing the syntax of
  individual solutions to look into their semantics. One of the common definitions
  of the semantic space in the context of symbolic regression is a n-dimensional space,
  where n corresponds to the number of training examples. In problems where this number
  is high, the search process can became harder as the number of dimensions increase.
  Geometric semantic genetic programming (GSGP) explores the semantic space by performing
  geometric semantic operationsâ€”the fitness landscape seen by GSGP is guaranteed to
  be conic by construction. Intuitively, a lower number of dimensions can make search
  more feasible in this scenario, decreasing the chances of data overfitting and reducing
  the number of evaluations required to find a suitable solution. This paper proposes
  two approaches for dimensionality reduction in GSGP: (i) to apply current instance
  selection methods as a pre-process step before training points are given to GSGP;
  (ii) to incorporate instance selection to the evolution of GSGP. Experiments in
  15 datasets show that GSGP performance is improved by using instance reduction during
  the evolution.'
