abstract: Sequential Symbolic Regression (SSR) is a technique that recursively induces
  functions over the error of the current solution, concatenating them in an attempt
  to reduce the error of the resulting model. As proof of concept, the method was
  previously evaluated in one-dimensional problems and compared with canonical Genetic
  Programming (GP) and Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP). In this paper
  we revisit SSR exploring the method behaviour in higher dimensional, larger and
  more heterogeneous datasets. We discuss the difficulties arising from the application
  of the method to more complex problems, e.g., overfitting, along with suggestions
  to overcome them. An experimental analysis was conducted comparing SSR to GP and
  GSGP, showing SSR solutions are smaller than those generated by the GSGP with similar
  performance and more accurate than those generated by the canonical GP.
