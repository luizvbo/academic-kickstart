abstract: 'This chapter proposes a generic framework to build geometric dispersion
  (GD) operators for Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming in the context of symbolic
  regression, followed by two concrete instantiations of the framework: a multiplicative
  geometric dispersion operator and an additive geometric dispersion operator. These
  operators move individuals in the semantic space in order to balance the population
  around the target output in each dimension, with the objective of expanding the
  convex hull defined by the population to include the desired output vector. An experimental
  analysis was conducted in a testbed composed of sixteen datasets showing that dispersion
  operators can improve GSGP search and that the multiplicative version of the operator
  is overall better than the additive version.'
