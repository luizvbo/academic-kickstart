abstract: The definition of a concise and effective testbed for Genetic Programming
  (GP) is a recurrent matter in the research community. This paper takes a new step
  in this direction, proposing a different approach to measure the quality of the
  symbolic regression benchmarks quantitatively. The proposed approach is based on
  meta-learning and uses a set of dataset meta-features---such as the number of examples
  or output skewness---to describe the datasets. Our idea is to correlate these meta-features
  with the errors obtained by a GP method. These meta-features define a space of benchmarks
  that should, ideally, have datasets (points) covering different regions of the space.
  An initial analysis of 63 datasets showed that current benchmarks are concentrated
  in a small region of this benchmark space. We also found out that number of instances
  and output skewness are the most relevant meta-features to GP output error. Both
  conclusions can help define which datasets should compose an effective testbed for
  symbolic regression methods.
